# easy-domain-gen
Generates an easy to speak domain name in English.

I want to generate a speakable domain name, comprised of two three letter words.
This program should:
1. Use the following rules for each three letter word:
1.a MUST not start with a vowel.
1.b MUST not end with a vowel.
1.c MUST not contain Q (hard to pronounce)
1.d MUST not contain O or ZERO (avoid confusion)
1.e MUST not contain L (avoid confusion)

2. Check if the domain exists.
3. Generate a CSV of all available permutations.
