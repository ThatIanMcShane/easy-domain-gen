# easy-domain-gen

August 26, 2019
I wanted to generate a speakable domain name, comprised of two three letter English words. The combination of words does NOT have to make any sense, pronounciation is the goal.

I had some time to kill on a flight and here's what I came up with.

I'd love comments or feedback on how to improve this.

Requires pyEnchant (pip install pyenchant)

See examples.py for usage.
